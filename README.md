# Task Management System - Database 2 Project

This repository contains the Task Management System, a project developed during my Database 2 class at Dawson College. Inspired by tools like JIRA, this system is designed to streamline team and task management by leveraging robust database functionality and a Java-based user interface.

The application allows users to log in as either admin or employee and provides features to manage teams, sprints, and tickets. It integrates a relational database to store and track employee activity, team information, sprints, and tickets, ensuring data consistency and reliability.

## Concepts Demonstrated
### This project demonstrates the following key concepts and skills:
- Database Design and Implementation: Designing a relational database to store and manage application data, applying normalization principles for efficient structure.
- PL/SQL Programming: Writing stored procedures, functions, triggers, and views to handle complex database operations.
- JDBC Integration: Connecting the Java application to the database using JDBC for seamless data manipulation and retrieval.
- User Authentication and Role Management: Differentiating functionality between admins and employees, with status tracking (e.g., setting logged-in users to "online" in the database).
- Team and Task Management: Enabling users to manage teams, add or modify sprints, and create, modify, and update tickets through the application.
- Requirements Analysis and Data Modeling: Completing requirements analysis and building an ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram) to model the database design.
### Features Overview
- Login System: Users log in as either admins or employees, with role-based access to functionality. The system records login status in the database.
- Team and Sprint Management:
- - View teams and associated sprints.
- - Add, modify, and complete sprints.
- Ticket Management:
- - Create, view, modify, complete, or set tickets to "in progress" for each sprint.
- Admin Privileges: Admin users can add employees to the system.
- Database Integration: The database stores all information related to employees, teams, sprints, and tickets. It utilizes PL/SQL for triggers and functions to maintain data integrity and streamline operations.
